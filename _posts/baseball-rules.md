In baseball, two teams of nine players each compete in a bat-and-ball sport, taking turns batting and fielding. The game progresses through various plays, typically starting when the pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball to the batter from the opposing team. The batting team aims to hit the ball into play, allowing their players to run around four bases counterclockwise to score "runs". Meanwhile, the fielding team's objective is to prevent batters from scoring and to stop runners from advancing.

The primary goal for the batting team is to get a player safely to first base, achieved by either the batter reaching first before the ball is retrieved by an opponent or through the pitcher's unsuccessful attempts to pitch within the batter's reach. Once on base, players can attempt to advance further during subsequent turns at bat. The fielding team seeks to prevent runs by getting batters or runners "out" of play. This can occur through various means, such as the pitcher achieving three strikes against the batter or fielders catching the ball before it hits the ground, or tagging a runner while they're not on a base.

The teams alternate between batting and fielding, with the batting team's turn ending after three outs are recorded by the fielding team. Each team's turn at bat constitutes an inning, and a standard game comprises nine innings. The team with the most runs at the end wins, with the possibility of extra innings if the score is tied. Unlike many sports, baseball has no game clock, although some leagues employ pace-of-play rules to manage game duration.

Baseball traces its roots to older bat-and-ball games played in England in the 18th century, evolving into its modern form in North America. It gained popularity in the United States, earning the title of "America's Pastime" due to its historical significance as a source of solace during challenging periods like the American Civil War and the Great Depression. While baseball holds a special place in American culture, it's also widely loved in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.

At the professional level, Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada is divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions. The MLB season culminates in the World Series, determining the league champion. Similarly, top-level play in Japan and Cuba is split into different leagues, with international competitions like the World Baseball Classic showcasing the best teams from around the globe. Baseball's Olympic journey saw it featured from 1992 to 2008 and reinstated in 2020.
