## Introduction

In baseball, two teams of <em>nine players</em> each compete in a bat-and-ball sport, taking turns batting and fielding. The game progresses through various plays, typically starting when the pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball to the batter from the opposing team. The batting team aims to hit the ball into play, allowing their players to run around four bases counterclockwise to score "runs". Meanwhile, the fielding team's objective is to prevent batters from scoring and to stop runners from advancing.

- **Primary Goal for the Batting Team:**
  - Get a player safely to first base. Achieved by either:
    - The batter reaching first before the ball is retrieved by an opponent.
    - The pitcher's unsuccessful attempts to pitch within the batter's reach.
- **Actions of the Batting Team After Reaching Base:**
  - Players can attempt to advance further during subsequent turns at bat.
- **Goals of the Fielding Team:**
  - Prevent runs by getting batters or runners "out" of play.
- **Ways the Fielding Team Achieves Their Goal:**
  - Pitcher achieving three strikes against the batter.
  - Fielders catching the ball before it hits the ground.
  - Tagging a runner while they're not on a base.

The teams alternate between batting and fielding, with the batting team's turn ending after three outs are recorded by the fielding team. Each team's turn at bat constitutes an inning, and a standard game comprises nine innings. The team with the most runs at the end wins, with the possibility of extra innings if the score is tied. Unlike many sports, baseball has no game clock, although some leagues employ pace-of-play rules to manage game duration.

Baseball traces its roots to older bat-and-ball games played in England in the 18th century, evolving into its modern form in North America. It gained popularity in the United States, earning the title of "America's Pastime" due to its historical significance as a source of solace during challenging periods like the American Civil War and the Great Depression. While baseball holds a special place in American culture, it's also widely loved in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.

At the professional level, Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada is divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions. The MLB season culminates in the World Series, determining the league champion. Similarly, top-level play in Japan and Cuba is split into different leagues, with international competitions like the World Baseball Classic showcasing the best teams from around the globe. Baseball's Olympic journey saw it featured from 1992 to 2008 and reinstated in 2020.

### Starting Lineup Positions

#### Pitcher

The pitcher is a crucial player on the field, responsible for initiating each play by delivering the baseball to the opposing batter. They must possess a diverse skill set, including accuracy, velocity, and strategic pitching techniques to outsmart hitters. Pitchers aim to throw strikes to induce swings and misses or weak contact, while also varying their pitches to keep batters off balance. They are the cornerstone of the team's defense, setting the tone for the game and often determining its outcome.

#### Catcher

The catcher is the backbone of the team's defense, serving as the field general behind home plate. They are responsible for receiving pitches from the pitcher, calling the game by selecting the appropriate pitches, and controlling the opposing team's running game by throwing out base runners attempting to steal. Catchers must also possess excellent defensive skills, including blocking pitches in the dirt, framing borderline pitches to influence the umpire's calls, and quickly reacting to bunts or pop-ups near home plate.

#### First Baseman

The first baseman plays a pivotal role in both defense and offense. Defensively, they are tasked with fielding ground balls and receiving throws from other infielders to record outs at first base. Offensively, first basemen are typically power hitters, capable of driving the ball for extra-base hits or home runs. They also contribute by getting on base themselves or advancing baserunners with well-placed hits or productive outs.

#### Second Baseman

The second baseman is a versatile player responsible for covering the area between first and second base on defense. They must have quick reflexes, good range, and strong throwing accuracy to turn double plays and prevent opposing hitters from reaching base. Offensively, second basemen often possess a combination of speed and hitting ability, capable of hitting for average, getting on base, and stealing bases to create scoring opportunities for their team.

#### Third Baseman

The third baseman is a skilled defender who must react quickly to field ground balls and make accurate throws across the diamond to record outs. They are often tasked with guarding the "hot corner," where hard-hit balls frequently come their way. Offensively, third basemen are typically power hitters capable of driving in runs with extra-base hits, though they also contribute by getting on base and advancing runners with productive plate appearances.

#### Shortstop

The shortstop is arguably the most athletic and versatile player on the infield, responsible for covering a large area between second and third base. They must have exceptional fielding skills, range, and arm strength to make difficult plays and turn double plays. Offensively, shortstops are often well-rounded players capable of hitting for average, getting on base, and providing occasional power, while also possessing speed on the basepaths to steal bases and score runs.

#### Left Fielder

The left fielder is positioned in the outfield and is responsible for fielding balls hit to their area and preventing runners from advancing extra bases. They must possess good speed, strong throwing accuracy, and the ability to track fly balls in order to make successful defensive plays. Offensively, left fielders contribute to their team's lineup by providing a combination of power and hitting ability, capable of driving in runs with extra-base hits and getting on base to set up scoring opportunities for their teammates.

#### Center Fielder

The center fielder is often considered the most important defensive player in the outfield, as they are responsible for covering the most ground and tracking down fly balls hit to all areas of the outfield. They must possess exceptional speed, agility, and instincts to make difficult catches and prevent extra-base hits. Offensively, center fielders are typically well-rounded players capable of hitting for average, getting on base, and providing speed on the basepaths to steal bases and score runs.

#### Right Fielder

The right fielder is positioned in the outfield and is responsible for fielding balls hit to their area and preventing runners from advancing extra bases. They must possess a strong throwing arm, good range, and the ability to track fly balls in order to make successful defensive plays. Offensively, right fielders contribute to their team's lineup by providing power and hitting ability, capable of driving in runs with extra-base hits and getting on base to set up scoring opportunities for their teammates.
